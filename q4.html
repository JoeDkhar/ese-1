            <h3>Taco Bell Cat With A Wound</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Melissa Vasquez. I am a rescuer and TNR trapper. I would like to share a story about a stray cat that I trapped in July 2023. Someone made a post on Next Door about a cat with a big wound on his neck outside of a Taco Bell.
                
                I saw the post on Facebook because multiple people were sharing the Next Door link. I saw multiple comments of people saying he had been like that for a couple days, and those comments made me so sad.
                
                As soon as I got out of work, I drove home and went to get a trap, wet cat food, tuna, and blankets because a rescue offered to take him. When I went to the Taco Bell, I couldn't find him, but I looked all around the business places for 48 minutes and found him behind the dumpster in the Taco Bell.
                
                As soon as I saw him, I got out of my car, set up my trap, and waited for him to go in. After 10 minutes of waiting, I trapped him and drove him to a rescue that offered to take him. The Cat Whisper Rescue Corporation's name is Bill. He is safe and getting treated at NVC, Nederland.

            <h3>My Little Bit</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                My husband and I were sitting on the porch one day talking when all of a sudden, I saw this kitten.  He was about starved to death, something had torn his ear, and he couldn't see out of one eye. I got some food and put it out for him. He would not let us get close to him. He slowly went to the food and gobbled it down. I also put water out.

                I kept doing this, and finally he would let me get close but still not touch him. He was scared to death of people. I kept working with him until finally he would let me touch him. He still would not let my husband touch him. I just kept working with him and finally decided to try to get him to come in the house. After much work and time, he finally came in.
                
                It has been four years now and I can happily say my Little Bit is the love of my life. I love this little cat so much. He still will not let anyone but me touch him. When I go to bed at night, he snuggles right up next to me and I rub him until he goes to sleep. I do not know what I would do without Little Bit.
                
                My husband passed away January 8, 2023, so Little Bit has filled a big hole in my heart. I don't know where Little Bit came from but I sure am glad he chose me and Joe.

            <h3>Fezzik</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>When my husband and I first moved to this house, there was a young cat living under our deck. After checking with some neighbors, I found out he did not have a home and was living under the deck because the man who lived in the house before us occasionally put food out for him.

                He did come out for food, but would run away if I even tried to touch him. It took some time and patience, but eventually he grew to trust me and let me pet him. After a few weeks, I was helping him learn how to come inside. He cried a lot at first but eventually realized it was a pretty cool place that always had toys and food for him.
                
                I checked with our local shelter, and found them to be pretty full of cats. So once I gained enough trust, I took him to the vet to get vaccinated and neutered and we adopted him ourselves. After having him tested for a few common diseases; treating him for worms, fleas, ticks, and ear mites; he was finally able to join our other cats.
                
                He has since become happy and healthy.
