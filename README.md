WEB STACK DEVELOPMENT SET 4

1. Develop an interactive web application that displays random images of cat breeds. The
application should fetch images from the The Cat API and display it on an HTML page.
(Whenever the Fetch button is clicked, Cat image should be fetched and displayed)
2.Additionally, include a sign-up form with validation for cat lovers.
3. Create a JSON file with 6 records with the following fields.
(Example-&quot;id&quot;: &quot;aege&quot;,&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Aegean&quot;,&quot;temperament&quot;: &quot;Affectionate, Social, Intelligent,
Playful, Active&quot;,&quot;origin&quot;: &quot;Greece&quot;,&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Native to the Greek islands known as the
Cyclades in the Aegean Sea, these are natural cats, meaning they developed without humans
getting involved in their breeding. As a breed, Aegean Cats are rare, although they are
numerous on their home islands. They are generally friendly toward people and can be
excellent cats for families with children.&quot;, &quot;life_span&quot;:&quot;9-12&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:

4. Make the About Us page with Heroes.
5. Enhanced Presentation: Ensure that the presentation of the data aligns with modern
design principles. Your implementation should focus on making the information accessible
and aesthetically pleasing.
6. Code Annotations: Add clear explanations within your codebase, describing the purpose
of key functions and methods. This will aid others in understanding your approach and logic.
